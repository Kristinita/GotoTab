The plugin allows you to switch to the numbered tab via a key binding. Currently bindings are only included for windows.

After you have installed the plugin; an example of use, if you have 3 files open in 3 tabs, pressing ctrl+1 will
switch to the first tab, ctrl+2 will switch to the second tab and ctrl+3 will switch to the third tab. ctrl+4 will
do nothing until you have a fourth tab open.
